Description:
------------
This plugin offers SVDRP connections as a service to other plugins.
Connecting to streamdev's VTP server port is possible, too. VTP provides
a subset of the SVDRP commands but in contrast to SVDRP it can handle
multiple connections at a time.

There's no reason to load this plugin if no other plugin relies on it.

If you are a developer and your plugin needs connections to a remote
SVDRP server, you might want to take a closer look at it. In particular
as long as an SVDRP server cannot interact with multiple connections at
a time, you will be able to share connections with other local plugins.

Configuration:
--------------
In the plugin setup you can configure a default server IP and a default
port, so you don't have to enter these values in the setup of all
plugins which use svdrpservice. Still you can override the default
settings in every plugin.

There's also a commandline option for the default server IP and port. Use
something like that:

  vdr ... -P 'svdrpservice 192.0.2.1:6419' ...

The port is optional and defaults to 6419. So this is equivalent:

  vdr ... -P 'svdrpservice 192.0.2.1' ...

Note that the default SVDRP port on VDR before 1.7.15 was 2001.

When using the commandline option, the options for default server IP and
port in the plugin setup will become read-only.

The default IP is used when the target IP of a new connection is either
an empty string or the special IP 0.0.0.0. Likewise default port is used
instead of destination port 0. If defaults have been used when opening
a connection, the service call will return the actual values to the
caller.

There are also two timeout settings, one for the initial connect and
one for reading replies. Increase these values carefully! A plugin which
calls svdrpservice from the VDR main loop will block the main loop
until the timeout expires when there's a problem with the connection.

Automatic charset conversion:
-----------------------------
If the client VDR (the one running svdrpservice) and the server VDR (the
one svdrpservice connects to) use different charsets, svdrpservice will do
an on the fly conversion of everything it sends and receives.

Usage:
------
Add a copy of header file "svdrpservice.h" if you want to use svdrpservice
in your plugin. Call the "Service" method to interact with svdrpservice.
There are two services available:
1. SvdrpConnection gets or releases an SVDRP server connection
2. SvdrpCommand sends a command and returns the results

Typically your plugin will require the following code snippets:

// include the svdrpservice header file
#include "svdrpservice.h"

// get the svdrpservice plugin
cPlugin *svdrpservice = cPluginManager::GetPlugin("svdrpservice");
if (svdrpservice == NULL) // TODO: ERROR

// get a connection handle. This will open the connection to the server
// or for a shared connection simply add a referer to the existing one.
SvdrpConnection_v1_0 conn;
conn.serverIp = "192.0.2.1";   // you must not use 127.0.0.1
                               // use "0.0.0.0" or "" for setup default
conn.serverPort = 6419;        // 6419 for SVDRP since VDR 1.7.15,
                               // 2001 for SVDRP before VDR 1.7.15,
                               // 2004 for VTP
                               // 0 to use svdrpservice setup default
conn.shared = true;            // share connection with others
conn.handle = -1;              // Handle < 0: get me a handle
SvdrpService->Service("SvdrpConnection-v1.0", &conn);
if (conn.handle < 0) // TODO: ERROR

// if defaults have been used, conn now contains the actual values
dsyslog("Connected to %s:%hu", *conn.serverIp, conn.serverPort);

// now you can send your commands
SvdrpCommand_v1_0 cmd;
cmd.handle = conn.handle;
cmd.command = "STAT\r\n";
SvdrpService->Service("SvdrpCommand-v1.0", &cmd);

// Check the response code. A code below 100 (currently only 0 is used)
// indicates a local problem (e.g. timeout while talking to the server).
#define EXPECTED 250
if (cmd.responseCode != EXPECTED) // TODO: ERROR

// Step through the reply
for (cLine *line = cmd.reply.First(); line; line = cmd.reply.Next(line))
   ...

// Finally release the connection (handle >= 0). This will close the
// SVDRP connection unless an other plugin still uses it.
SvdrpService->Service("SvdrpConnection-v1.0", &conn);

Debugging:
----------
Compile with SVDRPSERVICE_DEBUG=syslog if you want to see the commands
and replies in the log. Use SVDRPSERVICE_DEBUG=stderr (actually any
value will do) to get output on the terminal where you started vdr.
