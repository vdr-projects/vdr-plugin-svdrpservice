Description:
------------
This plugin offers SVDRP connections as a service to other plugins.
Connecting to streamdev's VTP server port is possible, too. VTP provides
a subset of the SVDRP commands but in contrast to SVDRP it can handle
multiple connections at a time.

There's no reason to load this plugin if no other plugin relies on it.

If you are a developer and your plugin needs connections to a remote
SVDRP server, you might want to take a closer look at it. In particular
as long as an SVDRP server cannot interact with multiple connections at
a time, you will be able to share connections with other local plugins.

Known issue:
------------
VDR 1.4.1-2 fixes a bug in the SVDRP server code which was introduced
in VDR 1.2.2. The server ignored client side closes of the connection.
The svdrpclient plugin is likely to trigger that bug as it will
disconnect if the server doesn't reply in time. In the patches
subdirectory you will find a patch for VDR 1.4.1-1 and older.

Usage:
------
Include the header file "svdrpservice.h" if you want to use svdrpservice
in your plugin. Call the "Service" method to interact with svdrpservice.
There are two services available:
1. SvdrpConnection gets or releases an SVDRP server connection
2. SvdrpCommand sends a command and returns the results

Typically your plugin will require the following code snippets:

// include the svdrpservice header file
#include "../svdrpservice/svdrpservice.h"

// get the svdrpservice plugin
cPlugin *svdrpservice = cPluginManager::GetPlugin("svdrpservice");
if (svdrpservice == NULL) // TODO: ERROR

// get a connection handle. This will open the connection to the server
// or for a shared connection simply add a referer to the existing one.
SvdrpConnection_v1_0 conn;
conn.serverIp = "192.168.0.1"; // you must not use 127.0.0.1
conn.serverPort = 2001;        // 2001 for SVDRP, 2004 for VTP
conn.shared = true;            // share connection with others
conn.handle = -1;              // Handle < 0: get me a handle
SvdrpService->Service("SvdrpConnection-v1.0", &conn);
if (conn.Handle < 0) // TODO: ERROR

// now you can send your commands
SvdrpCommand_v1_0 cmd;
cmd.handle = conn.handle;
cmd.command = "STAT\r\n";
SvdrpService->Service("SvdrpCommand-v1.0", &cmd);

// Check the response code. A code below 100 (currently only 0 is used)
// indicates a local problem (e.g. timeout while talking to the server).
#define EXPECTED 250
if (cmd.responseCode != EXPECTED) // TODO: ERROR

// Step through the reply
for (cLine *line = cmd.reply.First(); line; line = cmd.reply.Next(line))
   ...

// Finally release the connection (Handle >= 0). This will close the
// SVDRP connection unless an other plugin still uses it.
SvdrpService->Service("SvdrpConnection-v1.0", &conn);

Debugging:
----------
Compile with SVDRPSERVICE_DEBUG=syslog if you want to see the commands
and replies in the log. Use SVDRPSERVICE_DEBUG=stderr (actually any
value will do) to get output on the terminal where you started vdr.
