VDR Plugin 'svdrpservice' Revision History
-----------------------------------------

2013-06-07: Version 1.0.0

- Updated Makefile for VDR 1.7.36 and dropped compatibility with older VDR
  versions
- Added Slovak translation (thanks to Milan Hrala)
- Updated README. With the new VDR 1.7.34 Makefiles I think it's better to
  include a copy of svdrpservice.h in every plugin using svdrpservice.
- Updated default SVDRP port to new VDR default 6419.

2008-09-25: Version 0.0.4

- Italian translation (thanks to Diego Pierotto)
- Commandline parameter for default server IP and port (suggested by
  kris@vdrportal)
- Automatic charset conversion (suggested by skiller2k1@vdrportal)
  Includes patches for VDR < 1.6.1 to make it report its charset in the
  SVDRP greeting message
- Gettext support for VDR 1.5.7+
  Credits to Udo Richter for his po218n.pl backward compatibility script

- No longer strip trailing whitespace from responses
- Configurable timeouts

2007-03-06: Version 0.0.3

- Dynamic buffer size
- New setup options: default server IP and port

2006-07-24: Version 0.0.2
